The layout employs a modular, asymmetrical grid with generous spacing and rounded corners, creating a clean and approachable interface. Typography is a key visual element, using a bold, slightly italic sans-serif font for headings to convey innovation and emphasis, paired with neat, legible body text for clarity. UI elements such as buttons and containers use subtle borders and soft shadows to add depth without disrupting the minimalism. The overall style balances professionalism with a subtle dynamic character, suitable for tech and conference-related websites.",

The layout is modular and asymmetrical, using clear columns and rows with visible grid lines to evoke a sense of precision and order.

      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' black color predominantly for backgrounds and large text blocks to create strong contrast with the 'primaryForeground' white text. The 'secondary' orange color is reserved for call-to-action buttons, highlights, and interactive elements, paired with 'secondaryForeground' black text for readability. The 'lavenderGradientStart' and 'lavenderGradientEnd' colors form a smooth gradient used in large background blocks and overlays to add a modern, digital feel without overwhelming the design. The 'gridLine' color is used subtly for background grid lines to reinforce the structured, technical aesthetic. These colors should be combined thoughtfully to maintain accessibility and visual hierarchy, ensuring that text and interactive elements stand out clearly against their backgrounds.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primaryForeground' white text on 'primary' black background meets WCAG AAA contrast standards for all text sizes. The 'secondaryForeground' black text on 'secondary' orange background meets WCAG AA standards for normal text and AAA for large text. The lavender gradient colors provide sufficient contrast when used with black text for headings and body copy. The 'gridLine' color is light and used only for non-interactive background elements, ensuring no accessibility issues."
